## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
- It's partner coding like we do on Thursdays lol, one driver and one navigator.
2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
- It helps to have someone live-checking your code to make sure your train stays on the rails.
3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
- It can be a slower process as you have to make sure that both people are on the same page at all times, but I believe that even this can be negated by it almost ruling out the need to go back and fix things in most cases.
