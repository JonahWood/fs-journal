## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
- Scope is where certain variables are going to be available for use.
2. What is Hoisting ?
- Hoisting is when variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scope before executing the code.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- you would use const whenever you want a variable that will always have the same declared value no matter what, as it cannot be re-declared or updated. Using Let is better in situations where you may be using the same name for a variable multiple times in different scopes. There is almost no reason to be using Var anymore.
