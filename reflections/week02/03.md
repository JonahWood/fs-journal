## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
- Errors, testing javascript, and console logs. Console logs help show whether or not conditional statements are actually running, errors help show where your code needs fixing, and testing javascript is useful so you can test to see if the function does what you want it do before writing code to invoke it in your app.js.
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
- The elements tab.
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
- By using the File Navigator, however I feel this is made obsolete with the addition of bcw live.
