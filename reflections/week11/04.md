## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
- My biggest concern is that I will end up so overwhelmed by the final project that I'll end up falling behind so fast that I can't catch back up. However going through this course over the past couple months has made me more confident in my skills than ever, my peers are great and the staff helped all of us so much and really showed my that i know what im doing (even if i don't believe i do) i believe that this next week will be okay. Overall this course has been one of the most exciting and fun things I've ever had the chance to be apart of, there was never a dull or bad moment here and if i could go back and do it all again i absolutely would.
