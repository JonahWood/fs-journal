> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
- a sign can be the long string of "})" repeated many times, and it can be caused by the misinterpretation that JS reads from top down completing one line before the next.
2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
- it means that a function will take a set amount of time to return to you a result, whether that be the one you want or an error. Callbacks can store said code and run it when the time is appropriate.
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
- Keep your code shallow, modularize, and handle every single error.
